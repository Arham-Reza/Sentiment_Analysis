# Sentiment_Analysis
Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.
In this project we have worked with the twitter data set from NLTK which contains 5000 positive and 5000 negative tweets.
Data preprocessing is one of the critical steps in any machine learning project. It includes cleaning and formatting the data before feeding into a machine learning algorithm. For NLP, the preprocessing steps are comprised of the following tasks:

# Tokenizing the string

# Lowercasing

# Removing stop words and punctuation

# Stemming

Since we have a Twitter dataset, we'd like to remove some substrings commonly used on the platform like the hashtag, retweet marks, and hyperlinks.

We will be implementing logistic regression for sentiment analysis on tweets. Given a tweet, we will decide if it has a positive sentiment or a negative one. Specifically we will:

# Learn how to extract features for logistic regression given some text
# Implement logistic regression from scratch
# Apply logistic regression on a natural language processing task
# Test using our logistic regression
# Perform error analysis
